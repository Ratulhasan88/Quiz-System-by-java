# Quiz-System-by-java
## This software system allows the admin to record multiple multiple-choice questions with possible answers. When a student signs in, the system will prompt them to take a quiz from the quiz bank. When a user comes in with an admin login,
the system will indicate that the user is adding new questions to the question bank, and when a user enters in with a student credential, it will indicate that the user is distributing quizzes.
